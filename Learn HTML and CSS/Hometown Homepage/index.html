                <h3>Laknavaram Lake</h3>
                <p>Lakhnavaram Lake, about 70 kilometers away from Warangal, is a trending picnic spot. The lake is an
                    exceptional thing of beauty. The lake was formed by closing down three narrow valleys. Each valley
                    is replaced with a short bund, and hills act as their natural barrier. The lake has been constructed
                    by the rulers of the Kakatiya dynasty in 13th Century A.D.</p>
